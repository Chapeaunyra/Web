# Web stuff
*Here are some cool things to do in Web. I've made this repo as a memo because i'm lazy.*

## Button Glowing Border Effect
Some CSS to customize your buttons.

Advantages :
    Easy to make

Disadvantages
    To be done in last

## Dropdown Card Menu
Some code which made a perfect dropdown card menu.
You've got a nice profile picture, some texte as Name and a subtitle for the person.

After a click on a tiny little arrow, your menu will appear by expanding the card to show your options, as here with 'Edit Profile', 'Inbox', 'Settings', 'Support', 'Logout'.

Advantages :
    Beautiful, smooth and minimal

Disadvantages
    Not made for response design


## Loading Animations
One folder to make 3 differents loader theme.
The first simple, minimal, black and white.
The second is more colored, with more dots.
The third double his dots, change his color, moving and have a nice 'Loading ...' info.

Advantages :
    Fun to make
    Can be a base for more designs

Disadvantages
    Librairies and Services exists dude.


## Social Media Glass
A lot of css for making this one.
Black to white background, 5 social media and one effect of reflection to make this one.

Advantages :
    Omfg, so cool to see

Disadvantages
    Not really implementable in all design colors if you doesnt design your entire website with it.
    Can be useless to make if social media are small, in a corner of your screen
